    <h1>Dear Reader</h1>

    <p>Hello, Dear Reader</p>

    <p>
    Given the way that the modern internet works, and the total talk of any real path to this site, you probably don't exist. Even if you do, I don't have analytics for this page, so I'll never know. Isn't that great?
    </p>

    <p>
    I was a little young, dear reader, to truly experience web 1.0, but I've always liked the idea of a totally free, organic 'place' where anything can exist, and just a few people might get to see it. even more so now with the current state of the web (looking at you, Visa...)
    </p>

    <p>
    Without getting too uppity, dear reader, writing for that maybe-audience is always a fun experience. There isn't someone in front of you reacting to what you say, nor is it the wild stream of thoughts that end up in the journal. There's (probably not) someone at the other end, but I truly have no idea who you might be, so I can't contort myself into whatever I might imagine you like, or believe, or want to hear. You just get me. Hi, hope you're having a great day.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's an interesting way, dear reader, to get thoughts out. Ultimately, I'm writing this for me, but this little contrivance means that whatever I say should have some value to you, dear reader. This little call into the void, carrying whatever I think of out to whoever may (not) find it, these random thoughts now sitting on a server somewhere in Amazon's warehouses waiting for you to come along and ask what it has to say.
    </p>

    <p>
    If, dear reader, by some confluence of too much time and simple good fortune you do manage to find my little corner, I might only speculate to who you might be. Maybe I know you from out in the corporia - I've mentioned this silly little project one to many times and you decided to take a look. If so, Hi! We should get coffee some time. Otherwise, you've managed to dig so deep intot the small web that you've come across a site which is surely linked from nowhere, and  doesn't really lead anywhere either. What a strange one you must be!
    </p>

<h3>// --------- //</h3>

    <p>
    Permit me a moment to speculate, dear reader, on just who might make it to my little corner of the web. Maybe you're an old hat that never was too interested in the newer social netwerosk - they were always a little too easy and hey, maybe you saw this sorry state of affairs coming a decade ago. If so, congratulations - I wish more of us did. <br>

    You've got a little raspberry pi - a 3B - that you've set up in the cupboard to ping random domains as the link-well dried up. You've got a list of gems that I would never imagine sitting in a text file on a USB drive somewhere, an index of light corners and dark corners, portals to people and places precious few have permeated so far to percieve... alliteration is tricky. 
    </p>
    <p>
    You've seen sites born and sites die, falling off the web as the server bill came due or the maker grows up and sells their domain, or the pi on the desk is unplugged for the last time. You've seen tilde communities grow one-by-one, little ghosts around and alongside making and playing games, talking to each other with static pages and IRC, and you've seen blogs lay dormant for days and weeks and months and years, and IRC channels become a bit too quiet - Live sucks when there's no-one on the other end, hey? You realise that many of this once-thriving home away from home have lost their keys, and will never come here again. The server bill comes due.
    </p>

    <p>
    The pi in th cupboard does find something new every now and then, just enough to keep the ethernet plugged in, and it's a simple delight to look and see what it's come across this time - just often enough it's something clever or fun or surprising, and the text file grows a little. <br>
    Keep that little red light on, there's a few of us holding out against the dark. I'd ask for your list, but that's something earned.
    </p>

<h3>// --------- //</h3>

<p>
Maybe, dear reader, you come from a different world entirely. You've never plugged a VGA cabe, fought with a crappy 480p display or had to coax life out of a decrepit old laptop that really should have gone to e-waste. You've seen some reel about the 'old web' and decided to have a look around - it's a bit tricker, isn't it? I promise it's worth the trouble.
<br>
While you're here, remember that <em>everything</em> you see was crafted by <em>someone</em>. Not a massive team of engineers and designers guided by data and brand consultants, determining which shade of blue will make the user more likely to press our button instead of theirs, nor a complete newbie dropping paragraphs and animations into the Wix website builder (Don't use Wix, they're vampires), but someone who, with a little bit of learning and a can-do attitude, spun HTML markup and CSS styling (and maybe a little scripting) from a blank screen into something truly theirs.
</p>

<p>
This is the beauty of the small web. Everything you see on this page, simple and janky as it may be, dear reader, is <em>mine</em>. There's no box for me to put my pictures, or a list of whoever liked my post, there's no caption or comments constricted into 'twitter chirp' (that's what that font's called, apparently) to be nice and readable, there's no next post. You see this font because it's my favourite, these silly little dividers are what I felt like using tonight, and the background is my favourite shade of slate grey (#111111 if you're curious). It's just me, presenting this part of myself to you. Isn't that beautiful?
</p>

<h3>// --------- //</h3>

<p>
Or, dear reader, you are my corporeal friend from earlier. We were sitting in a coffee shop, got to talking, you showed me your little project and I mentioned mine. It reminded me that I built this little place and I should take care of it every now and then. Who knows why you actually decided to have a look - most people have better things to do - but you did. Maybe you, like me, got fed up with whatever's going in Zuckerberg's world this week, but still wanted some screen time. Maybe that pack of razor blades is looking enticing (it'll sting like a bitch in the morning), and you want something else to think about. I hope you're enjoying my diatribe, and you don't think I'm too much more of a weirdo than you already did. We should really get coffee some time, send me a text. Anyway.
</p>

<h3>// --------- //</h3>

<p>
To be completely honest, dear reader, you probably don't exist, and you quite likely never will. Even if you do, even if you've somehow found your way here, even if I've profiled you perfectly, and you've somehow gained something from this little diatribe, I'll likelely never know. I can imagine you, dear reader, to be whoever I want you to be, as I cast this part of myself near-unfiltered into the ether, waiting for a wanderer lost on the fringes of the largest meta-organism in the known universe, to ask my little server, wherever it may be in the world, for whatever it has to say. For that wanderer, in whatever place at whatever time, to see. Isn't that beautiful, in its own way?
</p>

<p>
To you, dear reader, who hasn't read this far because you don't exist, I offer you my sincerest thanks. My thanks not for taking the time out of your busy life to read the words of a random stranger online (because, again, you don't exist), but for your presence in my mind, that I can write to you for the benefit of no-one but myself, to practice in a dark corner of the web that no-one will ever see, as if someone will.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, dear reader, and I hope to see you again soon.
