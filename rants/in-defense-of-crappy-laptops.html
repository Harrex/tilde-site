        <h1>In Defense of Crappy Laptops</h1>

        <p>
        As time marches on, the devices we use get thinner, faster, fancier, and (usually) better - and our old stuff starts to
        really show its age. My 2023 Framework 13 looks and sounds beautiful, boots up in seconds, runs like a dream, and feels
        pretty good to use, and the old ThinkPad feels a bit pants by comparison, even running the latest software.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, with this power comes some real baggage. The keyboard doesn't feel too great, it's a bit thin and flimsy, and
        there's just a lot going on. The same machine that we write on can watch movies on-demand, can scroll through
        snapstagram, receives text messages from other people, and <em>dings</em> - The single-purpose gadget is dead,
        everything talks to everything else, and that's really cool for a lot of things. But when I want to just sit and write, this can be a real problem.

        Yes, we have Focus Modes or Do not Disturb or whatever else, but there's also the mental association - whatever part of
        the hindbrain knows that this machine can do things that are so much more fun, and when we sit down it's not necessarily
        clear what the actual goal is to that primitive part of the brain that decides whether we can work right now. Monkey
        brain doesn't deal with one physical object doing many things, and that's a problem that we haven't really had before. <br>

        On the other hand, at least for me, limiting the device feels like a real waste. Blocking movies or the internet wastes the capabilities
        of this device that I spent real money on, and why should we do that? Really, I need a little gadget that's just
        powerful enough to write, but not powerful or pretty enough to do anything more fun.

        Enter the old, broken, dusty, beaten up old Toshiba - Retired years ago but you never had the heart to throw it out, and
        Windows XP/7/8 is a hazard to connect to the internet and barely runs today. You need to deal with modern things
        occasionally, but also want to get things done in a minimal environment. <br>
        It's more than powerful enough to edit text files, though you might feel its age editing a Word Document, and the
        keyboard is just beautiful - Nice and compact, but snappy enough to be almost mechanical - The perfect typing machine.
