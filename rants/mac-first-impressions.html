    <h1>MacOS - The Grass is Always Browner</h1>

    <p>
      I went to the apple store and picked up a new M3 MacBook Pro a while back,
      because I knew eventually I'd need to build something for mac, and that M3
      performance and dedicated graphics did look enticing, but since then, it's
      sat on the shelf collecting dust because, frankly, for everything I do,
      Linux has been easier. The grass on my side of the fence is beautiful and
      green, and over there it doesn't seem so great.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I hear people, both in the real world and online, touting the
      incredible efficiency and integration of MacOS, and I see some of the
      people I really look up to, like Brian Kernigan or Theo (t3.gg), using them regularly.
      There must be <em>somethting</em> I'm not seeing that all these people
      are, so I've decided to dedicate the next (at minimum) few weeks to using
      exclusively MacOS (as much as possible) - The second monitor is gone
      (Thanks M3 vs M3 Pro), the desk arrangement is re-arranged, and the Linux
      laptop is in the back of the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to factory reset the Mac to get the best new experience I could,
      and I'm going to bring only the following over from Linux:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>My <code>.zshrc</code></li>
      <li>My neovim config</li>
      <li>My Security Keys</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Everything else will be done from scratch again, MacOS-style. I'll be
      writing down my thoughts here as we go.
    </p>

    <h2>Judging MacOS</h2>
    <p>
      I'll be judging MacOS mostly by how much it just gets out of the way and
      lets me work efficiently. For that to happen, the OS needs to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work consistently</li>
      <li>Not annoy me with things I don't want</li>
      <li>
        Let me customize things to a pretty significant degree (I want to think
        about things once, set them up, and never see them again until I want a
        change)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Windows 10/11, for the record, fails on all three of these pretty
      spectacularly. It annoys me with AI, notifications, forgets my mouse
      cursor, doesn't let me change it's behaviour much at all, and really
      doesn't get out of the way.
      <br />
      (It's also not Unix, which means I need WSL to get any real work done.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The various Linux distros I've used generally do pretty well with this -
      they're not perfect, of course - but they let me customize everything, the
      package manager lets me get set up much quicker, and with a tiling window
      manager that I can set up however I want, getting my workspace configured
      is (maybe not easy, but) a one-time thing.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup and First Impressions</h2>
    <p>
      I factory reset the MacBook and while I was setting it up I took some
      notes - I had 2 pages before I even saw the desktop. Here's a list of the
      things that would affect a brand-new user:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, there's no live environments - Linux distributions generally have
        a 'try before you buy' desktop on the installer with all the key
        features so you can see if you like it<br />
        It's not like I have a choice on the OS for this machine, but it would
        still be nice.
      </li>
      <li>
        During this setup process, it wouldn't connect to my external monitor.
        Once again, this would be nice.
      </li>
      <li>
        The accessibility settings seem pretty good, as someone who doesn't need
        them.<br />
        I do like the "Not Now" button - It's a lot like the doctor saying "See
        you again soon!"
      </li>
      <li>
        The Data & Privacy agreement wasn't nearly as egregious as Windows, but
        I'm used to nothing at all. I accepted this without too much concern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple ID was a bit of a hang-up - I would have liked to use this
        computer without signing in, but I know from experience that it would
        pester me until I gave in, so I just added my ID here.<br />
        it wanted me to sign in on my old, geriatric iPad that I read textbooks
        on, which didn't work - Just send me an email like everyone else,
        please.
      </li>
      <li>User account creation was the same as Linux - No complaints here.</li>
      <li>
        I did have an issue where it asked me for the old password to this Mac
        (I thought I wiped that!), and then didn't accept it because it was the
        same as the new password. I tried a few authentication methods there and
        ended up with a white screen, which was fun. I didn't get that fixed
        until much later (something to do wih end-to-end iCloud files, which I
        wasn't using anyway)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's a fine set-up progress, but it's seriously lacking the polish I was
      expecting. For a device that sells itself as the height of technology, and
      a seamless tool, its setup did have a few seams. The setup for Ubuntu or
      Pop!_OS is a bit friendlier, but it is beating Fedora and Windows.<br />
      The setup was mostly to-the-point, and covered everything it needed to
      (though turning off all the extra features was a bit of a pain), setting
      me up with a user account, fingerprint authentication and all those
      goodies. It didn't need to restart 12 times, but didn't feel as snappy as
      I was expecting, especially on this hardware.
    </p>

    <h2>The Desktop - First Impressions</h2>
    <p>
      I'll grant that the default desktop looks pretty nice - They pull off the
      basic top/bottom bar reasonably well, and most important things are
      accessible from here. I do take issue with the default settings this
      desktop comes with, however:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The dock has way too many icons<br />
        the first 75 seconds I spend on this computer shouldn't be spent
        right-clicking on things I don't want. I don't need a full office suite,
        a text editor, messages, phone, facetime, settings, the file explorer
        and an application launcher right here. I especiall don't need messages
        and phone because I don't have an iPhone, and Apple knows that because I
        signed in.<br />
        This massive dock also just makes the desktop look ugly, cluttered, and
        full instead of new and clean, especially because
      </li>
      <li>
        The screen is set to low-resolution<br />
        This computer's 3024*1964 screen pretends it's actually the pathetically
        small 1512*982 (most consumer laptops 5-10 years ago had 1920*1080
        screens) because the desktop components are illegible at these scales
        (The MacOS UI isn't scaled alongside the screen density).<br />
        Everyone else has been doing this for years - I paid for those pixels,
        let me use them!
      </li>
      <li>
        The mouse is a mess:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The mouse cursor doesn't look too great, and you can't change it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mouse sensitivity is really low, and acceleration is crazy<br />
            I can only imagine this is because the Apple mouse uses a 
            terrible, low-res sensor and if the sensitivity is any higher it's
            unusable.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I unset "Invert Scrolling" in the mouse settings, it unsets it
            for the trackpad. WHY?<br />
            I want my mouse to be one way and the trackpad to be the other,
            because that's what makes sense to me.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fastest pointer speed is still slower than I would like - Just
            let me set a number myself.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Connecting my external monitor wasn't fun either:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It seems to think my monitor is 100Hz (it isn't), and when it (by
            default) uses that it just kills the monitor (generally it needs to
            be restarted by pulling the power out).<br />
            The problem is, whenever I connect the monitor, the display settings
            move over there, which means I can't fix it because the monitor
            <em>isn't working</em>. There's a landmine sitting in the settings
            ready to take an hour out of my day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turns out this MacBook <em>Pro</em> Can't drive 2 external monitors
            because they didn't see fit to include that on the M3 model - I need
            the M3 <em>Pro</em> chip to do this (That's not how that works).
            Note that any decent laptop, including the old Intel Macs and the
            MacBook Airs can do this, because it's a relatively basic
            feature.<br />
            Bye-bye second monitor, I guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text everywhere looks extremely blurry on my 4k monitor. This is a
            problem with MacOS's font rendering not scaling to non-Apple-brand
            displays, and works perfectly on any other OS.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There were a few other little niggles, but the above serves my point well
      enough, I think. There's a real lack of polish here, and coming from my
      setup on Linux where windows arranged themselves to suit whatever task I
      was doing and I could get anywhere with one button, it's death by a
      thousand cuts.<br />
      To be entirely fair, the Linux setup is as good as it is thanks to a year
      and a half of tinkering and learning, but I've never seen issues like
      these anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really didn't like the UI at first, but after using the Mac for a while,
      I've come around to it a bit. It still isn't my favourite, but it gets the
      job done, and I can generally get where I want to go (more on that later).
      <br />
      Having everything just work can be nice too, if a little restrictive, and
      I do appreciate that the OS does what it does do pretty well, mostly.
    </p>
    <h2>First Impressions</h2>
    <p>
      That's enough for now. My MacOS experience so far hasn't been great, but
      I'm willing to keep going with it - I don't have anything urgent at the
      moment, and I'd like to see if it convinces me over time. There
      <em>must</em> be something here I'm not seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly doesn't "just work" and either MacOS or I will have to do
      some serious adjusting to be productive, but that's what a learning
      experience is.<br />
      I think it's important to try everything you get your hands on, and
      there's nothing worse than someone who thinks their grass is the greenest
      because they've never seen anywhere else. Whether I stick with it
      long-term or not (I'm not optimistic at the moment), I think I'll be
      grateful for the experience, and having used something different.
