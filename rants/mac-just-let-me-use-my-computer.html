    <h1>MacOS - Just Let Me Use My Computer</h1>
    <p> I've been putting of writing this for quite a while now, but I'm just furious today (I'll explain why a bit
        later), and I've decided that I'm done with using MacOS for serious work. Sure, there are things that 'just
        work' and the hardware is seriously impressive, but it's death by a thousand cuts - and
        when I try to improve my workflow, it feels like I need to work around so many artificial limitations and systems that just
        weren't meant to do what I want them to do. <br /> All this together means that I spend most of my time on this
        computer acutely aware of what kind of computer I'm using - which really isn't a good thing - and not once since
        I started using this laptop almost a month ago have I been able to just sit and work well for any amount of
        time. </p>

    <h2>Where am I coming from?</h2>
    <p> My home in the digital world is Linux (Arch &amp; Nix btw.), and I use a tiling window manager (Hyprland, if
        you're curious). While most Linux systems have full desktop environments with many of the same features (and a
        couple of the same limitations) of MacOS, my specific brand is a little different - It doesn't have a taskbar or
        a settings app, no window titlebars and you can't even minimize windows, and it's amazing. Hyprland does exactly
        what I tell it to do, exactly when I say to do it. Its configuration is one text file with all the power of the
        terminal, and there's really nothing else in the way. </p>

    <h2>Mac does that, but slower</h2>
    <p>
        Let's look at some simple tasks that I do every day, and how I accomplish them on Linux and MacOS:
    </p>
    <p> Let's say I want to read a website and take some notes: 
    <ul>
        <li>Under Hyprland, I press Super-F and Super-Enter at once
            (Super is like Command on Mac or the Windows Key) to open firefox and terminal, which have been automatically
            tiled to each half of the screen. I then open Neovim in my terminal with the <code>v</code> command (aliased),
            Super-left back to firefox, open my article and get started. That (minus finding the article) takes about 1
            second, and it's 4 keystrokes. </li>
        <li>Now let's do the same thing on MacOS. Press Cmd-Space for spotlight and search for firefox (hopefully I don't
            have it open anywhere else, because it'll tab me over there instead!), and do the same thing for terminal. Now
            both windows are sitting on top of each other, so I have to tile them. Luckily I only need 2 windows here, so I
            can mouse over the tiny green button (for a whole second) and <em>wait</em> for the drop-down to tile the
            windows. Now I enter Neovim the same way and Cmd-tab over to firefox to find my article. That's 18 keystrokes
            plus a second of hovering with the mouse over a tiny button. It takes a while, and whatever train of thought I
            had is gone. (Yes, I could have used mission control, but that's just as bad) Notice that I had to worry about
            whether I had firefox (or the terminal) open anywhere else, and I really had to problem-solve my way through
            this. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Now I'd like to listen to some music - Let's be charitable to MacOS and say I use a desktop client like Spotify
        (or Apple Music) rather than a web- or terminal- based one (Mac doesn't have any good way to deal with those):
        <ul>
            <li>
                Under Hyprland, I press Super-K, which pops up spotify above whatever else is going on. If it's not open,
                it opens it. I set my music, and then press Super-K again when I'm done.
            </li>
            <li>
                On Mac, I have to remember whether Spotify is already open - If it isn't, press Cmd-space, type Spotify. If it
                is, then I can find it in the Cmd-tab menu (which means that I have to press tab many times, which is slow). I
                set my music, then Cmd-Tab back to my terminal. <br> Problem is, now when I go to Cmd-Tab to firefox, it takes
                me to Spotify, so I have to remember that's going on. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Now I need a new window on the screen to do something else, say read some earlier notes: 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Under Hyprland I press Super-Enter to open a new terminal, and get to my file. Automatically the other windows shrink a
            little to make space and everything is arranged sensibly. To switch windows, I can use Super+{Left, Right, Up, Down}.
            When I close that, the other windows go back to how they were before.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is where Mac gets painful. Those two windows I had open are in a weird split-fullscreen pseudo-workspace
            <em>thing</em>, and this can't deal with more than two windows, so tiling's busted. I press the little green
            button to exit fullscreen, and only one of the windows leaves. I have to Cmd-Tab back to the other one and
            un-fullscreen that too. Now they're on top of each other. I Cmd-Tab to the terminal and press Cmd-N to get
            another one (because there's already a terminal open, spotlight would just focus that one), and then
            <em>manually resize the windows to fit</em>. By the time I'm done with that I've probably forgotten whatever it
            was I was meant to do, so I'll work that out again and do it. <br> Cmd-Tab also doesn't work very well now
            because there's two windows of the same type, so I have to decide between Cmd-Tab or Cmd-` depending both on
            where I am and where I want to be.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Need I go on? These things seem like minor inconveniences on their own, but when I do these small tasks
        sometimes hundreds of times every day, that's real time. It's also real thought that's going into these little
        tasks that could be going toward whatever work I'm doing. What this means is that on the Mac, I can never get
        into any kind of flow state where I just work. There's always something annoying me - these windowing problems,
        poor font rendering (optimised only for Apple's own Retina displays), pointless notifications (Looking at you,
        Tips), and some serious bugs. </p>

    <h2>Mac Does Some Things Really Well, but They Can Be Hard to Find</h2>
    <p> I've spent a lot of this page ranting about issues with the desktop environment, and I do that because, for me,
        it's the single most important thing about how my computer is set up. As long as it's powerful <em>enough</em>,
        and the battery lasts long <em>enough</em>, and the screen is decent <em>enough</em>, the important thing is how
        fast I can get the computer do something, not how fast the computer can do it. While there have been moments the
        Mac has wowed me with its speed, especially in converting large files and the retina screen does have its
        moments, the slow, clunky desktop hamstrings these features and prevents this incredible piece of hardware from
        shining - by the time I've opened the terminal, my Linux machine would be done with most tasks anyway, and
        because the Mac desktop doesn't scale its UI components (like buttons and text), actually running the retina
        screen at its full resolution makes Mac unusable. </p>

    <h2>The Apple Ecosystem</h2>
    <p> Even using a Mac, I've been pretty reluctant to enter the 'Apple ecosystem' - I don't use the app store, ever,
        though I do buy music on iTunes occasionally. I can message my iMessage-using friends, though I can't talk to
        Android users, who make up about half of the people I need to talk to (I don't have an iPhone, and I have no
        intention of getting one), so I really don't care all the interconnected features they advertise. 
        I want my computer to compute, and my phone to talk to other people, not my computer. </p>

    <h2>It Just Works!</h2>
    <p> Finally, we've come to my final straw, and the reason I'm so furious - the bugs. When I turned my computer on
        this afternoon, my external monitor didn't power on. I had this issue when I got the Mac, and I fixed it then -
        the Mac seems to think my monitor is 100Hz instead of 60Hz (not an issue on other devices), but it had forgotten
        my settings. Problem was, the settings window was on the external monitor. I spent quite a while just moving the
        mouse around on a broken screen to try and find the settings window and drag it back to the main screen, where I
        could set it back. And this is pretty representative of my MacOS experience really - it's just filled with bugs,
        poor design (I didn't mention the shortcuts, where it's really difficult to fit anything new in), issues that
        no-one at Apple seems to have considered and problems, and more problems. </p>

    <p>
        The Mac is a powerful machine, don't get me wrong, and for some work you really can appreciate that, but it's
        held back by some interesting choices in how the OS should work, and a failure to adopt recent (&gt;30 years ago
        on Linux) advancements like basic tiling. While I have alleviated some of these problems using external programs
        (check out yabai, skhd, and Raycast), there are core issues and deficiencies in MacOS that don't seem to be
        fixable. The mac has it's uses, but for a $3000 'Pro' computer, 'has its uses' is a pretty scathing review. Most
        likely, it'll go back to collecting dust on my shelf with occasional use for some graphics work until the Asahi
        project brings Linux to the M3, when I might take another look at the laptop, purely from a hardware
        perspective.

    <p>
        For now, back home to Linux, and back to getting things done.
