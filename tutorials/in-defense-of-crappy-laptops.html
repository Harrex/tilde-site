    <h1>Writing on an Old Laptop</h1>

    <p>
        As time marches on, the devices we use get thinner, faster, fancier, and (usually) better - and our old stuff
        starts to
        really show its age. My 2023 Framework 13 looks and sounds beautiful, boots up in seconds, runs like a dream,
        and feels
        pretty good to use, and the old ThinkPad feels a bit pants by comparison, even running the latest software.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, with this power comes some real baggage. The keyboard doesn't feel too great, it's a bit thin and
        flimsy, and
        there's just a lot going on. The same machine that we write on can watch movies on-demand, can scroll through
        snapstagram, receives text messages from other people, and <em>dings</em> - The single-purpose gadget is dead,
        everything talks to everything else, and that's really cool for a lot of things. But when I want to just sit and
        write, this can be a real problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yes, we have Focus Modes or Do not Disturb or whatever else, but there's also the mental association - whatever
        part of
        the hindbrain knows that this machine can do things that are so much more fun, and when we sit down it's not
        necessarily
        clear what the actual goal is to that primitive part of the brain that decides whether we can work right now.
        Monkey
        brain doesn't deal with one physical object doing many things, and that's a problem that we haven't really had
        before. <br>

        On the other hand, at least for me, limiting the device feels like a real waste. Blocking movies or the internet
        wastes the capabilities
        of this device that I spent real money on, and why should we do that? Really, I need a little gadget that's just
        powerful enough to write, but not powerful or pretty enough to do anything more fun.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enter the old, broken, dusty, beaten up old Toshiba - Retired years ago but you never had the heart to throw it
        out, and
        Windows XP/7/8 is a hazard to connect to the internet and barely runs today. You need to deal with modern things
        occasionally, but also want to get things done in a minimal environment. <br>
        It's more than powerful enough to edit text files, though you might feel its age editing a Word Document, and
        the
        keyboard is just beautiful - worn down by the years, but still snappy enough to be almost mechanical - The
        perfect typing machine.
    </p>

    <h1>Get On With the Tutorial!</h1>

    <p>
        We'll be using Linux - Whatever you think about it, there's nothing better for getting an old machine up and
        running in
        most cases. Every laptop is different, especially these kinds of devices, so you'll probably have some trials
        and
        tribulations that I can't cover here. Google is your friend.
    </p>

    <h2>Arch btw.</h2>

    <p>
        I'll be using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> - They advertise themselves as "A Simple,
        Lightweight
        Linux Distribution" - the understatement of the century. <br>

        They do have an installer script, but it has some real <em>personality</em>, and I wouldn't trust it on any
        interesting
        devices - That means we're doing this install ourselves. Trust me, it's not all bad. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>The Install - Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        Whatever anyone else (including me) says, you always want to look at the <a
            href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide">Arch Wiki Installation Guide</a> as the final
        source of truth. It gets updated as Arch changes, and is a fantastic resource, though it can be a little scary. I'll
        elaborate on some sections that I had trouble with when I was learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Preparing an Installation Medium</h3>
    <p> 
        Head to the downloads page (I won't link it here, because links like that die too quickly), and look for a mirror
        nearby. I'm in Australia, so the Australian Academic and Resource Network (AARNET) is a good choice for me. Verifying
        the signatures is a good idea, but if you trust your download source, it's not crazy important for a little project like
        this. <br>

        Generally, you'll want a USB boot disk for anything relatively modern. Take a look at <a
            href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Balena Etcher</a> which is very good at flashing images. Pick your file, pick your
        USB stick (DON'T choose the wrong one, you can wipe your system here), and press the green button.
    </p>

    <h3>Booting to the Installation Medium</h3>
    <p>
        Now you'll need to get the target laptop to boot to a USB stick. Normally when you turn the computer on, it will look at
        its internal storage for an Operating System, but we'll need to tell it to boot elsewhere.<br />

        You'll need to get into the firmware interface - this is different for every laptop, but try mashing one of ESC, F2,
        F10, F12 as the laptop is turning on, and see if you get anything interesting (If you don't have any luck, google
        &lt;Your Laptop&gt; BIOS key). Once you find some kind of menu, you're looking for something like 'Setup Options'. Turn
        <em>off</em> Secure Boot if you can find it, and set the USB first in the boot order. You can also look for a boot menu,
        and select the USB that way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you see something with the Arch Linux logo, go with the first option (<em>Arch Linux Install Medium</em>), and wait
        for the blinking cursor.
    </p>

    <h3>Welcome to the Shell!</h3>
    <p>
        A good chunk of this process will be on the command line - It's not that scary, but it's probably worth getting some
        familiarity with it. If you have access to a Mac or Linux devices, it's really worth having a look at Zach Mandeville's
        wonderful guide, <a href="https://coolguy.website/map-is-the-territory/">The Map is the Territory</a>. It's a bit quirky
        but it does a great job of introducing this interface.
